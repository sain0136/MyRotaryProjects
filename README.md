# Rotary Clup Development 
Scoping, designing, and developing a custom full-stack web application in Typescript using an AdonisJS backend and Vue.js frontend to replace the previously manual project lifecycle management process used by the district. 
## Project Status:
This project is currently in development.  
## Reflection: 
This project was contracted out from Rotary District 7040 to me. A Rotary District 7040 district chair member desired a way for his district to move their Rotary grant application, pledge tracking, and reporting processes to a web application. I took the contract on in Novemeber 2022, as a soon to be graduate of the two-year Computer Programming Ontario College Diploma program from Algonquin College. I have worked on this project part-time while finishing the program and then transitioning to working full-time as an Information Technology Support Technician based out of Cornwall with the Canadian Mental Health Association - Champlain East,
since December 2021. The experience has been amazing, and I will continue to improve and make this app ready for real world deployment and scalable growth to the satisfaction of Rotary District 7040 and any future districts that will use my website.

The technologies that are implemented in this project are Vue.js 3 with Typescript for the front-end and Adonis.js for the backend. Cleavr and GitHub Actions are being used for server and deployment management. TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, SASS, HTML5 and Tailwind CSS are  languages/technologies also in use.
